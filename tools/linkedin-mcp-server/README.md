# LinkedIn MCP Server

Small local MCP server for publishing normal LinkedIn feed posts through the official LinkedIn API.

This independent local automation tool is optional and is not part of an application runtime.

## What It Supports

- Build a LinkedIn OAuth authorization URL.
- Exchange an OAuth authorization code for an access token.
- Dry-run a text post payload.
- Dry-run an image post payload.
- Publish a text post only when `dryRun` is `false` and `confirmPublish` is `true`.
- Upload one PNG/JPG/GIF image and publish an image post only when `dryRun` is `false` and `confirmPublish` is `true`.

The extra publish confirmation is deliberate. A LinkedIn post is an external side effect and should never happen by accident.

## LinkedIn Requirements

Create a LinkedIn Developer App and request the required scopes:

- `w_member_social`: publish as the authenticated member. This comes from the Share on LinkedIn product.
- `w_organization_social`: publish as an organization/page where the authenticated member has the required page role. This usually requires an app/product upgrade or additional LinkedIn approval.

For organization posting, LinkedIn restricts access to company pages where the authenticated member has one of the supported roles such as administrator/content admin. Use an author URN like:

```text
urn:li:organization:123456
```

For personal posting, use:

```text
urn:li:person:PERSON_ID
```

## Configuration

Copy `.env.example` to a local `.env` file or pass the same values through your MCP client environment:

```text
LINKEDIN_CLIENT_ID=...
LINKEDIN_CLIENT_SECRET=...
LINKEDIN_REDIRECT_URI=http://localhost:3000/callback
LINKEDIN_SCOPES=openid profile w_member_social
LINKEDIN_ACCESS_TOKEN=...
LINKEDIN_API_VERSION=202605
```

Do not commit real tokens or secrets. `.linkedin-token.json` is ignored by Git.

## Run

```bash
cd tools/linkedin-mcp-server
npm start
```

The server loads `tools/linkedin-mcp-server/.env` automatically when the file exists. MCP clients can still pass the same values through their own `env` block.

Example MCP client configuration:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "linkedin": {
      "command": "node",
      "args": [
        "C:/path/to/repository/tools/linkedin-mcp-server/src/server.mjs"
      ],
      "env": {
        "LINKEDIN_CLIENT_ID": "...",
        "LINKEDIN_CLIENT_SECRET": "...",
        "LINKEDIN_REDIRECT_URI": "http://localhost:3000/callback",
        "LINKEDIN_ACCESS_TOKEN": "...",
        "LINKEDIN_API_VERSION": "202605"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

## OAuth Flow

Fast local helper:

```bash
cd tools/linkedin-mcp-server
npm run auth
```

The helper:

1. Loads `.env`.
2. Starts a local callback server at `LINKEDIN_REDIRECT_URI`.
3. Prints a local start URL, normally `http://localhost:3000/start`.
4. Exchanges the returned authorization code.
5. Saves the token response to `.linkedin-token.json`.
6. Prints the access token so you can put it into `LINKEDIN_ACCESS_TOKEN`.

Open the local start URL instead of opening the callback URL directly. The start URL creates a fresh OAuth `state` and redirects to LinkedIn.

Manual MCP-tool flow:

1. Call `linkedin.oauth_url`.
2. Open the returned URL in a browser.
3. Approve the LinkedIn scopes.
4. Copy the `code` query parameter from the redirect URL.
5. Call `linkedin.exchange_code` with `persistToken: true`.
6. Put the returned access token into `LINKEDIN_ACCESS_TOKEN`.

## Posting Flow

After OAuth, call `linkedin.me` first. It returns the authenticated member profile and a `personUrn` value:

```text
urn:li:person:PERSON_ID
```

Use dry-run first:

```json
{
  "authorUrn": "urn:li:person:PERSON_ID",
  "commentary": "Hello from our team",
  "dryRun": true
}
```

Then publish explicitly:

```json
{
  "authorUrn": "urn:li:person:PERSON_ID",
  "commentary": "Hello from our team",
  "dryRun": false,
  "confirmPublish": true
}
```

## Official API Notes

LinkedIn Posts API requires:

- `Authorization: Bearer ...`
- `Linkedin-Version: YYYYMM`
- `X-Restli-Protocol-Version: 2.0.0`

Image posts use:

1. `POST https://api.linkedin.com/rest/images?action=initializeUpload`
2. `PUT` the image bytes to the returned upload URL
3. `POST https://api.linkedin.com/rest/posts` with the returned `urn:li:image:...`
